This project was about creating a sorting algorithm that sorts a random set of numbers using two stacks. The twist: we could only use a limited amount of moves to do it.

I ended up implememnting another 42 student's invention "Turk's algorithm", which was more optimized to succeed in this project than the traditional sorting algorithms, whose optimizations lie elsewhere, like speed or memory.

I took this project as an opportunity to really dive into linked lists, as they had been somewhat unknown to me before.
Quite ambitious, but it paid off.
